# CoLoRS

These workflows are written in [Workflow Description Language (WDL)](https://openwdl.org/) to support creation of the Consortium of Long Read Sequencing database ([CoLoRSdb](https://colorsdb.org)). Variant databases produced from this workflow are found at DOI [10.5281/zenodo.11511512](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11511512).

## Workflow

The cohort-level CoLoRS workflow performs alignment, quality control, variant calling, joint-calling small variants and structural variants for a cohort. The workflow can run using Azure, AWS, GCP, and HPC backends but has not been tested on all these platforms.
